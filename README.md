# Pokemon-Battle-Simulator

  A simple networking game accross a local area networking game for the CS 21B (Introdution to Computing II) Final Project. For the project I created a pokemon battle simulator that can be played accross two computers through the same network.


## Description

  The game is an emulation of the pokemon game, specifically the battle system of the game. The game includes a selection of different pokemon, along with a selection of moves that can be used for each pokemon within the party. Although the moves are limited to those that inflict damage only and any and all other side effects of these moves were removed to maintain the game's simplicity. 

  The game also allows for a full range of customization for both the player and the pokemon itself. The player is able to change sprites and names that will be reflected and seen within the game. On the pokemon side of the customization, you are able to select from a limited selection of moves for the pokemon which stay true to the original game. This means that the moves that you can learn are limited to the moves that the pokemon can actually learn in the original game. In addition a full range of EV customizations can be made to the pokemon as well.

Although a limitation to the game is that it is limited to a 1 on 1 style of battle where in victory is claimed by defeating the opponents single pokemon. The first player to eliminate the other player's pokemon is the winner. 

## Mechanics

  The Mechanics of the game follow closely to the original pokemon game where in both players select a move for their pokemon. After both players have selected a move the damage is dealt. This process continues until one player is deemed the victor. As for the controls of the game, the enter key is used to select and the shift key is used to go back or deselect.

  For the Menu Screen, a player can choose from the selection to edit his player or edit his party. Either selection will lead the player to a separate screen where he/she can select from the different customizations available. Now for starting the game one player must select to create the server while another selects to find the server and a prompt will appear asking for the IP address. The IP address that must be input is the IP address of the server, the game and battle will not commence until a connection is made.
